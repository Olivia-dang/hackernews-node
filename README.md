The goal of this tutorial is to build an API for a Hacker News clone. 

# Technologies

- Apollo Server 2.18: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance and great developer experience, graphql-js and more.
- Prisma: Replaces traditional ORMs. Use Prisma Client to access your database inside of GraphQL resolvers.
- GraphQL Playground: A “GraphQL IDE” that allows you to interactively explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending queries and mutations to it. It’s somewhat similar to Postman which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs. Among other things, GraphQL Playground:
    - Auto-generates comprehensive documentation for all available API operations.
    - Provides an editor where you can write queries, mutations & subscriptions, with auto-completion(!) and syntax highlighting.
    - Lets you easily share your API operations.
